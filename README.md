# quiz_app

An app created with the guidance of a [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/). It's the app built from the first module and I have added some of my styles on it.

## Getting Started

To run the project you just have to clone it and run:

- `flutter pub get`
- `flutter run`

And the app should run on you connected device or emulator, you're good to go! Any doubts just open an issue on this repo and we can work it out.
